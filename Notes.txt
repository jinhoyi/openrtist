Benchmark for simple streaming version
(zeroMQ request-reply streaming from Flex to Gabrial, raw frame buffer)
For Screen scaled to Height = 640

pre = serial zeroMQ calls, infer = cv2 image compression to jpeg
Big_screen:
pre 6.8, infer 5.7, post 12.9 ms
Small_screen:
pre 2.5, infer 4.7ms

After switching to BGR (from RGB whlie doing glReadPixel)
Big_screen:
pre 6.7, infer 5.8, post 12.9 ms
Small_screen:
pre 2.4, infer 3.6, post 7.8ms

After Compressing on Flex (pre = sening imu, infer = getting frame buffer)
Big_screen:
pre 0.1 ms, infer 4.4 ms, post 4.6 ms, wait 0.5 ms, fps 195.8
Small_screen:
pre 0.1 ms, infer 3.2 ms, post 3.4 ms, wait 2.6 ms, fps 166.50

For Screen scaled to Height = 960
Big_screen:
pre 0.0 ms, infer 7.4 ms, post 7.5 ms, wait 0.9 ms, fps 119.88
Small_screen:
pre 0.1 ms, infer 3.6 ms, post 3.7 ms, wait 0.6 ms, fps 233.73

Calling compressJpeg during updateFrame()
For Screen scaled to Height = 960
